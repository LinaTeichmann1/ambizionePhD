        <h1>PhD Position on Colour Perception (University of Geneva)</h1>
        <div class="instructions">
            <p>We are inviting applications from prospective PhD students to join the Laboratory for Behavioral Neurology and Imaging of Cognition (PI: Prof Patrik Vuilleumier) at the University of Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
            <p>The role is funded by a SNSF Ambizione Grant awarded to Dr. Lina Teichmann to study individual differences in visual processing using colour vision as a model. Colour space is the ideal testing ground to characterize subjective visual experiences, as it is a biophysically well-defined and constrained space, and it varies substantially across people. The project aims to make precise predictions about subjective colour experiences based on variability in the sensory apparatus, genetic profile, and language, and relate these to densely sampled MEG data from individuals.</p>
            <p>The start date for this position is flexible but is possible at the earliest from October 2025 onwards. Applications are open until the position is filled. We're looking for applicants with a Masters degree in neuroscience, computer science, psychology or a related field. Research experience with human participants as well as computational skills are a great plus, but comprehensive training can be provided. The project is part of an international and interdisciplinary collaboration, so we are looking for someone with a collaborative mindset.</p>
            <p>The lab is based at Campus Biotech in Geneva, offering exceptional resources and many opportunities to learn new skills. The PhD student will be affiliated with the Department of Fundamental Neuroscience within the Faculty of Medicine. They will be enrolled in the Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School (<a href="https://wp.unil.ch/lemanicneuroscience/" target="_blank">Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School</a>) which offers access to the vibrant academic communities around Lake Geneva.</p>
            <p>For questions and to discuss the project, role, and hiring process in more detail, please do not hesitate to reach out. To apply, please <a href="mailto:lina.teichmann@outlook.com?subject=Application%20PhD%20Position%20UNIGE-Teichmann">send us an email</a> with a brief cover letter including research interests and your CV.</p>
